## Walktober

### Problem

  John participates in an annual walking competition called *Walktober*. The competition  runs for a total of **N**

 days and tracks the daily steps of the participants  for all the **N** days. Each participant will be assigned a unique ID ranging from  1 to **M** where **M**

 is the total number of registered participants. A global scoreboard  is maintained tracking the daily steps of each participant.

  John is determined to win Walktober this year and his goal is to  score the maximum daily steps on each of the **N**

 days among all the participants.  Having participated in Walktober last year as well, he wanted to know how many steps  he fell short of in achieving his goal. Given the previous year scoreboard,  calculate the minimum additional steps he needed over his last year score in order  to achieve his goal of scoring the maximum daily steps every day.

### Input

  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test  cases follow.  
  The first line of each test case contains three integers **M**, **N**, and **P**  denoting the total number of participants, the total number of days the  competition runs, and the last year participant ID of John.  
  The next **M** lines describe the scoreboard of the previous year and contains  **N** integers each. The *j*-th integer of the *i*-th line  denotes the step count **S****i****,****j** of the participant with ID *i* on the  *j*-th day of the competition.

### Output

  For each test case, output one line containing  `Case #x``: y```, where *x* is the test case number  (starting from 1) and *y* is the minimum total additional steps needed by  John to achieve his goal.

### My Solution

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int T;
int m,n,p;

int main() {
    cin>>T;
    for(int t=1;t<=T;t++) {
        cin>>m>>n>>p;
        vector<vector <int>> arr(m,vector<int>(n));
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
                cin>>arr[i][j];
            }
        }
        int cnt=0;
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
            int ma=arr[p-1][j];
            for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
                if(arr[i][j]>ma)
                    ma=arr[i][j];
            }
            cnt+=ma-arr[p-1][j];
        }
        cout<<"Case #"<<t<<": "<<cnt<<endl;
    
    }
    
	return 0;
}
```



## Curling

### Problem

  2022 is a year of the Winter Olympics! Curling has been one of the most  popular winter sports as it requires skill, strategy, and sometimes a bit of  luck.

  In a curling game, two teams compete by sliding heavy granite stones on a long  ice sheet. We call the teams the *red* team and the *yellow* team,  as their stones are usually distinguished by the red and the yellow handle  color. A curling game consists of several *ends* (subgames); in every  end, the teams, each owning 8

 stones, take turns to slide them across  the long ice sheet toward a circular target area called the *house*. A  stone may hit existing stones to change its own moving direction and other  stones' position (including knocking them out of play). Roughly speaking, the  goal for a team is to make their stones as close to the center of the house as  possible.

  Geometrically, a house and a stone can be modeled as a circle and a disk (the  region bounded by a circle), respectively, and the scoring rules at the  conclusion of each end are formally summarized as follows.

- ​    Each stone can be viewed as a disk of radius **R****s** on a 2

-dimensional    plane.  The house is a circle of radius **R****h** centered at (0,0)

.

​    Only stones *in the house* are considered in the scoring. A stone is in    the house if any portion of the stone lies on or within the circle    representing the house. Tangency also counts.  

​    A team is awarded 1 point for each of their own stones in the house    such that no opponent's stone is closer (in Euclidean distance) to the    center than it. We assume in this problem that no two stones are equally    close to the center (0,0)

- .  

  Two teams are playing and have just delivered all their stones. The red team  has **N** stones remaining on the curling sheet, centered at (**X****1**,**Y****1**),(**X****2**,**Y****2**),…,(**X****N**,**Y****N**), while the yellow team has **M** stones  remaining, centered at (**Z****1**,**W****1**),(**Z****2**,**W****2**),…,(**Z****M**,**W****M**)

. Now you are asked to figure out the scores of both teams.

### Input

  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T**

 test  cases follow.

  Each test case begins with a line containing the two space-separated integers  **R****s** and **R****h**.  The next line contains the integer **N**. Then **N** lines follow, the *i*-th  line of which containing the two space-separated integers **X****i** and **Y****i**.

  After that, similarly, the next line contains the integer **M**. In the next **M**  lines, the *i*-th line contains the two space-separated integers **Z****i** and  **W****i**.

### Output

  For each test case, output one line containing  `Case #x`

`: y`` z```, where *x* is the test case  number (starting from 1), *y* is the score of the red team, and *z* is  the score of the yellow team.
